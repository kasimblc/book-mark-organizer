# Bookmarks Organizer Extension

A Chrome Extension designed to help you organize your bookmarks more efficiently. This extension allows you to sort selected bookmark folders alphabetically, place subfolders at the top, and offers several additional features to manage and clean up your bookmarks. While this extension has been tested on Microsoft Edge, it should also work on other Chromium-based browsers.

## Features

- **Alphabetical Sorting:** Sort the contents of the selected bookmark folder alphabetically, with subfolders placed at the top.
- **Subfolder Management:** Option to include subfolder data in the organization process. You can also choose to organize bookmarks within subfolders.
- **Domain-Based Organization:** Automatically creates folders for specific domains if the number of bookmarks from that domain exceeds a specified threshold.
- **Merge and Organize:** Combine bookmarks from subfolders into the selected folder, and organize them periodically.
